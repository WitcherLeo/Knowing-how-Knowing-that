# TARA

## About TARA
We propose the Knowing-how & Knowing-that task that requires the model to answer various questions about a user manual. We resolve it by representing the steps and facts of a user manual in a unified graph named TARA. To benchmark it, we design an efficient method and annotate a testing set derived from real-world customer service scenarios.
